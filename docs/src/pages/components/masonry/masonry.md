# Masonry

<p class="description">Masonry lays out contents of different sizes as blocks of the same width and variable height with configurable gaps.</p>

Masonry maintains a list of content blocks with a consistent width but variable height. The contents are ordered by row. If a row is already filled with the specified number of columns, the next item starts another row, and it is added to the shortest column.
